## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added

- `--json` flag for machine-readable JSON output on all commands (design, cost, compare, validate, export, diff, catalog search, catalog compare)
- `--version` flag to print the installed version string
- `--verbose` / `-v` flag to show full tracebacks on errors
- `--pricing-tier` option on `cost` command (on_demand, reserved_1yr, reserved_3yr, spot)
- D2 diagram export formats: `d2`, `d2-svg`, `d2-png`
- `mermaid-svg` and `mermaid-png` export format variants
- `cloudwright policy` command for policy-as-code compliance engine
- Global error handler in all commands — clean error messages with `--verbose` for stack traces
- JSON error responses when `--json` flag is active and a command fails

### Changed

- Architect: enforce exact service keys from LLM (no invented compound keys like `rds_postgres`)
- Architect: add Terraform resource type mapping for state/config parsing
- Architect: service name normalization layer with engine suffix extraction
- Catalog: adjust fallback prices for container orchestrators (EKS, GKE, AKS, ECS)
- Catalog: add debug logging for fallback pricing lookups
