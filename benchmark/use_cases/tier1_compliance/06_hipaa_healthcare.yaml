name: "HIPAA-Compliant Healthcare Patient Portal"
tier: 1
category: "compliance"
prompt: >
  Design a HIPAA-compliant patient portal on AWS for a regional hospital network. The portal
  allows patients to view medical records, schedule appointments, and message their care team.
  All data storage must use encryption at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.2+). Use RDS
  Aurora PostgreSQL for PHI data with automated backups retained for 7 years, S3 with server-side
  encryption for medical imaging, ECS Fargate for the application tier, and CloudTrail with
  CloudWatch for comprehensive audit logging of all PHI access. Only use AWS services that are
  covered under the AWS Business Associate Agreement. Implement MFA for all staff logins via Cognito.
