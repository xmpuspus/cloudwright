prompt: >
  Design a PCI-DSS Level 1 compliant payment processing platform on AWS for a fintech company
  processing 500,000 transactions per day. The cardholder data environment must be in a dedicated
  VPC with strict network segmentation — payment processing Lambda functions in a private subnet
  with no internet access, a WAF in front of the API Gateway for the public-facing payment API,
  KMS for all encryption key management, RDS PostgreSQL in a separate isolated subnet for
  tokenized card data, and CloudTrail with GuardDuty for intrusion detection. All cardholder
  data must be tokenized before storage. Include VPC Flow Logs for network-level audit trails.
