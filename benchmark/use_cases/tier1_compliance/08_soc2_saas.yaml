  separation, Cognito for SSO with SAML 2.0 support for enterprise identity providers, CloudTrail
  for comprehensive change management audit trails, Config for continuous compliance monitoring,
  and Security Hub for centralized security findings. Implement automated evidence collection for
  SOC 2 auditors. Include a CI/CD pipeline with mandatory peer review gates via CodePipeline.
