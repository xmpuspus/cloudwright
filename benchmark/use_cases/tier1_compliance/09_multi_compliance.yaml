prompt: >
  Design an AWS architecture for a healthcare payments company that must simultaneously satisfy
  HIPAA (for protected health information) and PCI-DSS (for payment card data). The platform
  processes insurance claims and patient copayments. Architect separate VPCs for the PHI workloads
  and cardholder data environments with no direct connectivity between them — use a dedicated
  API Gateway with WAF as the integration layer. Both environments need KMS encryption, CloudTrail
  audit logs, and GuardDuty threat detection. The PHI environment uses Aurora PostgreSQL; the
  payment environment uses RDS with tokenization via Lambda. MFA required for all human access.
