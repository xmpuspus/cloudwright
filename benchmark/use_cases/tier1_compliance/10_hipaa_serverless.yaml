tier: 1
category: "compliance"
prompt: >
  Design a HIPAA-compliant serverless architecture on AWS for a telehealth startup that needs
  to minimize operational overhead while maintaining full compliance. Use API Gateway with
  Lambda authorizers for all PHI-touching endpoints, Lambda functions in a VPC for PHI processing
  (required for HIPAA), DynamoDB with encryption at rest for appointment and messaging data,
  S3 with SSE-KMS for video consultation recordings, and Macie for automated PHI discovery and
  classification in S3. All Lambda functions must run in a private VPC subnet with no public
  internet access — use VPC endpoints for DynamoDB and S3. CloudTrail must log all API calls.
  Budget under $800/month at 5,000 monthly active patients.
