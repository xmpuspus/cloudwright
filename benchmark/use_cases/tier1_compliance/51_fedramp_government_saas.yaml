prompt: >
  Design a FedRAMP Moderate authorized SaaS platform on AWS for a US federal government agency.
  The platform hosts sensitive but unclassified (SBU) government data and serves 5,000 agency
  users. Implement FIPS 140-2 validated encryption at rest and in transit across all data stores.
  Use EC2 with a hardened AMI for the application tier behind an Application Load Balancer with
  WAF for OWASP protection and Shield for DDoS mitigation. Store data in RDS with automated
  snapshots retained for 1 year per NIST 800-53 requirements. Use S3 with server-side encryption
  and object lock for audit log immutability. Deploy GuardDuty, Config, and CloudTrail across
  all regions for continuous monitoring and incident response. Use KMS with customer-managed keys
  for all encryption. The entire environment must run within a dedicated VPC with no internet
  egress except through approved NAT gateways. Budget is $8,000/month.
