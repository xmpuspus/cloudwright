name: "GDPR-Compliant EU SaaS Platform"
tier: 1
category: "compliance"
prompt: >
  Design a GDPR-compliant SaaS platform on AWS hosted entirely in the EU (eu-west-1) for a
  European HR software company serving 500 SME customers. The platform processes employee
  personal data as a data processor under GDPR Article 28. Implement data residency controls
  to prevent EU personal data from leaving eu-west-1. Use Cognito with MFA for identity and
  access management, including a self-service consent management portal for data subjects to
  exercise Article 17 right-to-erasure requests. Store customer data in RDS PostgreSQL with
  field-level encryption via KMS for personally identifiable fields. Use CloudFront with an
  EU-only origin to serve the web application, and ALB for backend routing. Enable CloudTrail
  to satisfy Article 30 records of processing activities. Use S3 with lifecycle policies to
  enforce data retention limits per customer DPA agreements. Budget is $5,000/month.
