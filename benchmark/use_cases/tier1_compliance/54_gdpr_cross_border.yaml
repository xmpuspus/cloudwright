tier: 1
category: "compliance"
prompt: >
  Design a GDPR-compliant cross-border data processing platform on AWS for a multinational
  e-commerce company with customers in the EU and operations in the US. The platform must
  enforce data transfer controls so EU personal data is only replicated to non-EU regions
  under Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs). Use Lambda for stateless order processing
  functions that apply data minimization principles. Use SQS to decouple the EU-originating
  event stream from downstream fulfillment workers, with a policy that keeps EU personal data
  payloads encrypted via KMS before cross-region transit. Store the EU master dataset in RDS
  PostgreSQL in eu-west-1 and use DynamoDB with TTL for transient session data subject to
  shorter retention periods. Maintain an S3 data lake for anonymized analytics, with bucket
  policies restricting writes from non-anonymization Lambda functions. Enable CloudTrail across
  all regions for audit trails supporting GDPR Article 30 accountability obligations. Budget
  is $10,000/month.
