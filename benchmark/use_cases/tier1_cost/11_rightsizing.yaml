prompt: >
  We have an over-provisioned AWS fleet that's costing $8,000/month but should cost under $3,000.
  Current state: 20x m5.2xlarge EC2 instances (8 vCPU, 32GB RAM) running a web application where
  CloudWatch shows average CPU at 12% and memory at 18%. They sit behind an ALB with RDS PostgreSQL
  db.r5.2xlarge (also over-provisioned at 15% CPU). Design the rightsized architecture: recommend
  correct instance types based on actual utilization, implement auto-scaling groups with min/max
  limits appropriate to the workload, and switch RDS to a db.t3.large with Performance Insights.
  Calculate the projected monthly savings.
