prompt: >
  Compare the monthly cost of running an identical 3-tier web application on AWS, GCP, and Azure.
  The application requirements: 4 application servers (4 vCPU, 16GB RAM), a managed PostgreSQL
  database (4 vCPU, 16GB RAM, 500GB storage, Multi-AZ), a Redis cache (2 nodes, 6GB each), a
  load balancer, 10TB monthly egress bandwidth, and a CDN for static assets. Map to equivalent
  managed services on each cloud: AWS (ECS/RDS/ElastiCache/ALB/CloudFront), GCP
  (Cloud Run/Cloud SQL/Memorystore/Cloud Load Balancing/Cloud CDN), Azure (AKS/Azure Database for
  PostgreSQL/Azure Cache for Redis/Azure Load Balancer/Azure CDN). Provide total monthly cost for
  each cloud and highlight the cheapest option per component.
