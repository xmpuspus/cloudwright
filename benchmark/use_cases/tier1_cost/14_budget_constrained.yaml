  Design a fully functional web application on AWS that costs under $100/month for a bootstrapped
  indie developer. Requirements: serve a React SPA, a Python REST API, a PostgreSQL database,
  user authentication, file uploads, and background job processing. Maximize serverless and managed
  services to minimize fixed costs — the app handles 500 daily active users with traffic peaks
  during business hours. Use Lambda for the API (pay per request), DynamoDB on-demand for the
  database, S3+CloudFront for the frontend, Cognito for auth (50,000 MAU free tier), SQS for
  background jobs, and RDS PostgreSQL db.t4g.micro with reserved pricing if it fits the budget.
  Justify every component choice by its cost contribution.
