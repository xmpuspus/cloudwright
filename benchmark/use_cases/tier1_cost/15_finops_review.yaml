  Perform a FinOps review of an existing AWS architecture billing $12,000/month and identify savings
  opportunities. The current architecture: 15x m5.xlarge EC2 (avg 20% CPU utilization), 3x RDS
  db.m5.large Multi-AZ (avg 25% CPU, 30% storage used), 5TB/month NAT Gateway data transfer,
  2TB S3 Standard storage (85% accessed less than once per month), ElastiCache r5.large cluster
  (avg 35% memory used), and $800/month in unused Elastic IPs and orphaned EBS snapshots. Redesign
  the architecture with Compute Savings Plans, S3 Intelligent Tiering migration, Graviton3 instance
  equivalents, and right-sized RDS. Project the new monthly cost and ROI timeline for any upfront
  commitments.
