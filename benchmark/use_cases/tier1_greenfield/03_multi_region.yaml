  Design an active-active multi-region architecture on AWS deployed in us-east-1 and eu-west-1.
  Use Route 53 with latency-based routing and health checks for global traffic management,
  CloudFront for static asset delivery, ECS Fargate for the application tier in each region,
  DynamoDB Global Tables for the database layer with cross-region replication, and S3 Cross-Region
  Replication for file storage. The system must tolerate a complete regional outage with automatic
  failover under 60 seconds. Budget is $5,000/month across both regions.

  provider: aws
