  Design a hybrid cloud architecture connecting an on-premises data center to AWS. The on-premises
  environment hosts legacy ERP systems that must remain on-prem due to data sovereignty requirements.
  Connect via AWS Direct Connect with a 1 Gbps dedicated connection. In AWS, deploy EC2 instances
  in a private VPC for workloads that need access to the on-prem ERP, RDS PostgreSQL for cloud-native
  data, S3 for archival and backup of on-prem data, and a Transit Gateway to manage routing between
  the VPC and on-premises network. Include VPN as a Direct Connect failover. Budget is $2,000/month
  for the AWS side.
