  Design a fully serverless API backend on AWS for a mobile application with 10,000 monthly active
  users. Use API Gateway (HTTP API) as the entry point, Lambda functions in Python for business
  logic, DynamoDB for the primary database with on-demand billing, S3 for user-uploaded media with
  CloudFront distribution, and Cognito for user authentication and JWT token management. Include
  SQS for async task processing and SNS for push notifications. The entire stack must scale to zero
  when idle. Budget must stay under $200/month at current traffic levels.
