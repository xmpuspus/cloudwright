  Import and document an existing small AWS deployment from Terraform state. The infrastructure
  was deployed by a developer who has left the company — there is a terraform.tfstate file
  in S3 but no readable Terraform code. The state contains: 2 EC2 t3.medium instances, 1 RDS
  MySQL db.t3.small, 1 ALB with 2 target groups, 1 S3 bucket, 1 VPC with 2 public and 2 private
  subnets, and associated security groups. Import this state, generate a clean ArchSpec, calculate
  the current monthly cost, and identify any compliance issues (the company needs SOC 2).

  provider: aws
  budget_monthly: 500
