prompt: >
  Import a complex production AWS architecture from a Terraform state file with 180 resources
  spanning multiple modules. The infrastructure includes: an EKS cluster with 3 managed node
  groups across 3 AZs, RDS Aurora PostgreSQL cluster with 2 reader replicas, ElastiCache Redis
  cluster mode with 3 shards, an ALB with path-based routing to 5 target groups, CloudFront
  distribution with multiple origins, Route 53 hosted zone with 12 records, 4 S3 buckets with
  different lifecycle policies, and a VPC with complex routing tables. Parse the state, create
  a structured ArchSpec grouping resources by logical tier (frontend, api, data, networking),
  and estimate the monthly cost with savings recommendations.
