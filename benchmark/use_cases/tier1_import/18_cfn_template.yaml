  Import and analyze a production CloudFormation template with 85 resources deployed to a
  healthcare company's AWS account. The stack contains: a multi-AZ VPC, ECS Fargate cluster
  with 3 services and a load balancer, RDS Aurora PostgreSQL with encryption enabled, S3 buckets
  with SSE-KMS and versioning, CloudTrail with CloudWatch Logs integration, WAF with OWASP
  managed rules, and Cognito user pool with MFA enabled. Parse the CloudFormation template,
  generate an ArchSpec, run a HIPAA compliance validation against the imported architecture,
  and identify any gaps between what CloudFormation deployed and HIPAA requirements.
