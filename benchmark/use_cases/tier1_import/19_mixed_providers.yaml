  Import and consolidate an architecture spread across AWS and Cloudflare from two separate
  Terraform state files. The AWS side: ECS Fargate application, RDS PostgreSQL, ElastiCache,
  and an S3 bucket. The Cloudflare side: DNS zones, Workers for edge logic, R2 storage buckets,
  and WAF rules. Merge these into a single ArchSpec that captures all components across both
  providers, maps the network connections between AWS and Cloudflare (Cloudflare Workers proxying
  to AWS ALB), and calculates a blended monthly cost. Identify any redundancy between AWS CloudFront
  and Cloudflare's CDN capabilities.
