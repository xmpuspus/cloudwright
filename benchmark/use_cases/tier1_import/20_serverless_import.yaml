  Import an existing Serverless Framework deployment from AWS that was built by a contractor.
  The deployment spans 3 services: an auth service (5 Lambda functions, Cognito, API Gateway),
  a data service (8 Lambda functions, DynamoDB tables, SQS queues, S3 buckets), and a
  notification service (3 Lambda functions, SNS topics, SES). Each service has its own
  serverless.yml and deploys to separate CloudFormation stacks. Parse the CloudFormation stacks,
  generate a unified ArchSpec showing how the three services interconnect, calculate the monthly
  cost at current invocation rates (2M Lambda invocations/day total), and identify cold start
  risks and any over-provisioned memory configurations.
