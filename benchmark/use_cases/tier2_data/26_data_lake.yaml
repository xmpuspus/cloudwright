tier: 2
category: "data"
prompt: >
  Design a scalable data lake architecture on AWS for a logistics company ingesting 500GB of
  structured and semi-structured data daily from 15 operational systems. Use S3 as the storage
  backbone with a three-tier structure (raw/curated/analytics zones), Glue for ETL jobs and
  the Data Catalog (Hive Metastore compatible), Athena for ad-hoc SQL queries with Workgroups
  for cost control, Lake Formation for fine-grained column and row-level data access control,
  Kinesis Data Firehose for real-time data ingestion from event sources, and QuickSight for
  business intelligence dashboards. Include S3 lifecycle policies to transition data to
  Intelligent-Tiering after 30 days and Glacier Deep Archive after 2 years. Budget is $4,000/month.
