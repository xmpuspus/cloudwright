prompt: >
  Design a real-time streaming analytics platform on AWS for a ride-sharing company processing
  driver location updates, ride events, and surge pricing signals at 50,000 events per second.
  Use Kinesis Data Streams with 50 shards for ingestion, Kinesis Data Analytics (Flink application)
  for stateful stream processing to compute 1-minute rolling aggregations and surge multipliers,
  DynamoDB for the low-latency surge pricing lookup table updated by Flink, Kinesis Data Firehose
  for archiving raw events to S3 Parquet, Redshift for historical analysis and BI queries, and
  ElastiCache Redis for real-time driver location caching. The entire pipeline must have an
  end-to-end latency under 2 seconds from event ingestion to pricing update.
