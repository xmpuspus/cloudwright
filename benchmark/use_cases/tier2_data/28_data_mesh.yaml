prompt: >
  Design a data mesh architecture on AWS for a multinational retail company with 6 domain teams
  (sales, inventory, marketing, finance, operations, and customer). Each domain owns its data
  products. Use a federated governance model: each domain team has its own AWS account, S3
  data lake, and Glue catalog. Cross-domain data sharing via AWS Lake Formation data sharing
  across accounts without data copying. A central governance account manages IAM permission
  boundaries and Lake Formation tag-based access control. EventBridge for domain event publishing,
  S3 presigned URLs for data product APIs, and a central DataZone portal for data discovery.
  Redshift Serverless in the analytics account for cross-domain queries. Budget is $15,000/month
  across all accounts.
