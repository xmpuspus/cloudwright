prompt: >
  Design a change data capture (CDC) pipeline on AWS to migrate and continuously sync a
  production Oracle database (on-premises, 2TB, 200 tables) to a modern cloud-native data
  stack with zero downtime. Use AWS DMS for initial full load and ongoing CDC replication,
  with Oracle as source and a combination of targets: Aurora PostgreSQL for the operational
  replica (for application cutover), Kinesis Data Streams for real-time change events, and
  S3 via Kinesis Firehose for the data lake. A Lambda function consumes the Kinesis stream
  to maintain a DynamoDB change log for audit purposes. Include DMS Task Assessment and
  SCT (Schema Conversion Tool) for the Oracle-to-PostgreSQL migration. Estimate costs
  during the migration window and steady-state post-cutover.
