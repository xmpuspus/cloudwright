  Design an ML feature store on AWS for a recommendation engine serving 5M users with real-time
  personalized recommendations. The feature store needs both an online store (low-latency feature
  serving, p99 < 20ms) and an offline store (feature materialization for training). Use SageMaker
  Feature Store as the managed backbone with DynamoDB as the online store backend and S3 Parquet
  as the offline store. Glue jobs for daily feature materialization pipelines, SageMaker Pipelines
  for model training that reads from the offline store, SageMaker real-time inference endpoints
  with auto-scaling for predictions, and a Lambda-based feature ingestion API that writes to both
  online and offline stores atomically. ElastiCache Redis for sub-millisecond feature serving for
  the hottest user segments. Budget is $12,000/month.
