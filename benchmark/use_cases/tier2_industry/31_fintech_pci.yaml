prompt: >
  Design the AWS infrastructure for a cryptocurrency exchange platform that also handles fiat
  currency and must maintain PCI-DSS Level 1 compliance. The platform processes 10,000 trades
  per second at peak. Architecture: API Gateway + NLB for the trading API (NLB needed for
  WebSocket connections for real-time order book), EKS for the matching engine with dedicated
  m6i.metal nodes for predictable latency, ElastiCache Redis for the in-memory order book,
  Aurora PostgreSQL for trade settlement records, Kinesis Data Streams for trade event auditing,
  KMS with HSM backing for all cryptographic operations, GuardDuty and Security Hub for threat
  detection, and WAF with rate limiting to prevent market manipulation bots. Hot wallet keys
  stored in CloudHSM, not KMS.
