prompt: >
  Design the cloud infrastructure for an Electronic Health Record (EHR) platform on AWS that
  will be used by 500 physician practices and process records for 2 million patients. The
  platform must be fully HIPAA-compliant. Key requirements: HL7 FHIR R4 API via API Gateway
  and Lambda for interoperability, Aurora PostgreSQL Multi-AZ for structured PHI with column-level
  encryption using KMS, S3 with SSE-KMS for medical imaging (DICOM files, expect 50TB), a
  dedicated VPC with no public subnets for the data tier, AWS PrivateLink for all AWS service
  access, Macie for PHI scanning and classification, Config with custom rules for continuous
  HIPAA evidence collection, and CloudTrail Organization Trails for a 7-year audit log retention.
  All inter-service communication must use mutual TLS.
