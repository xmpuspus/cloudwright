prompt: >
  Design an e-commerce platform on AWS that handles 10x traffic spikes during Black Friday —
  normal load is 5,000 concurrent users, peak is 50,000. The architecture must scale in under
  5 minutes. Use CloudFront with aggressive caching for the product catalog (CDN cache hit rate
  > 80%), ECS Fargate with Application Auto Scaling for the API tier with target tracking on
  CPU, Aurora PostgreSQL with read replicas for product/order data, ElastiCache Redis cluster
  for cart sessions and inventory locks, SQS for order processing queue to absorb spikes, DynamoDB
  on-demand for the session store (no capacity planning required), and a pre-warming strategy
  for Lambda functions and Aurora serverless. Run load tests monthly and document the scale-out
  timeline. Budget $4,000/month baseline, up to $15,000 during peak events.
