prompt: >
  Design a multi-tenant SaaS platform on AWS for a project management tool serving 1,000
  enterprise tenants with varying sizes (small: 10 users, enterprise: 10,000 users). Implement
  a tiered isolation model: free-tier tenants share ECS tasks and an RDS database with schema
  isolation, professional-tier tenants get dedicated ECS tasks but shared RDS with RLS, and
  enterprise tenants get dedicated ECS tasks, dedicated RDS instances, and dedicated ElastiCache.
  Use Cognito with custom domains for per-tenant SSO, API Gateway with usage plans and API keys
  for rate limiting per tenant, CloudFront with Lambda@Edge for tenant routing based on subdomain,
  and EventBridge for tenant-scoped event processing. Include a control plane ECS service for
  tenant provisioning and billing metering. Budget is $20,000/month.
