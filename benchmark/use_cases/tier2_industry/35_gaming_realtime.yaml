  Design the backend infrastructure on AWS for a real-time multiplayer battle royale game
  supporting 500,000 concurrent players across 10,000 simultaneous matches. Match sessions
  require ultra-low latency (< 50ms to game server). Use GameLift FlexMatch for matchmaking
  with skill-based matching, GameLift on EC2 Spot fleets (c5.2xlarge) for dedicated game
  servers with automatic session management and interruption handling, a Global Accelerator
  for anycast routing players to the lowest-latency region, DynamoDB Global Tables for player
  profiles and leaderboards with global replication, ElastiCache Redis for real-time presence
  and match state, API Gateway WebSocket for the lobby chat system, and Kinesis Data Analytics
  for real-time cheating detection using player telemetry. Target budget is $30,000/month
  at 500K concurrent users.
