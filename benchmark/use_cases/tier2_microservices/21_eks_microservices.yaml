  Design a production-grade microservices platform on AWS EKS for an e-commerce company with
  12 independent services. The platform needs: EKS 1.29 with managed node groups (3x m5.xlarge
  per AZ, across 3 AZs), AWS Load Balancer Controller with ingress for external traffic, service
  mesh via AWS App Mesh or Istio for inter-service communication, RDS Aurora PostgreSQL for
  stateful services that need SQL, DynamoDB for high-throughput catalog and cart services,
  ElastiCache Redis for distributed sessions and rate limiting, ECR for container registry,
  and CloudWatch Container Insights for observability. Include Cluster Autoscaler for node
  scaling and KEDA for pod-level event-driven scaling. Budget is $6,000/month.
