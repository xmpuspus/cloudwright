prompt: >
  Design a production microservices platform on Google Kubernetes Engine for a media streaming
  company. Use GKE Autopilot for zero-node-management operations, Cloud Load Balancing with
  NEGs for container-native load balancing, Anthos Service Mesh (Istio) for mTLS between services,
  Cloud SQL PostgreSQL for relational data, Firestore for real-time user preference data, Memorystore
  Redis for session caching, Artifact Registry for container images, and Cloud Monitoring with
  distributed tracing via Cloud Trace. Implement Workload Identity for secure service-to-GCP-API
  authentication without service account keys. The platform serves 1M daily active users streaming
  video. Budget is $8,000/month.
