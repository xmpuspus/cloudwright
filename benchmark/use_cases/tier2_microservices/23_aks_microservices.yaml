  Design a microservices platform on Azure Kubernetes Service for a retail company migrating
  from on-premises. Use AKS with system and user node pools (Standard_D4s_v5 nodes), Azure
  Application Gateway with AGIC for ingress, Open Service Mesh for service-to-service encryption,
  Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server for order management, Azure Cosmos DB for
  product catalog with global distribution, Azure Cache for Redis for session state, Azure
  Container Registry with geo-replication, and Azure Monitor with Container Insights for
  observability. Use Azure Key Vault with CSI driver for secrets management. Enable Azure
  Policy for Kubernetes to enforce resource limits. Budget is $7,000/month.
