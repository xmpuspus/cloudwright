  Design an event-driven microservices architecture on AWS for an order management system that
  processes 100,000 orders per day across 8 domains: order intake, payment, inventory, fulfillment,
  shipping, notifications, analytics, and fraud detection. Use EventBridge as the central event
  bus with domain-specific event patterns, SQS FIFO queues for guaranteed ordering in payment
  and inventory, SNS fan-out for notifications, Lambda for lightweight event processors, ECS
  Fargate for stateful services (order management, inventory), DynamoDB for order state, and
  Kinesis Data Streams for high-throughput analytics events. Include DLQs on all queues with
  CloudWatch alarms for DLQ depth. Budget is $3,000/month.
