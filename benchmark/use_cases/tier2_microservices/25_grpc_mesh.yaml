  Design a high-performance gRPC-based service mesh on AWS EKS for a financial data platform
  where latency is critical — p99 must be under 10ms for inter-service calls. Use EKS with
  Nitro-based C6i instances for consistent network performance, Istio service mesh with gRPC
  load balancing (L7 load balancing aware of HTTP/2 streams), Envoy sidecars with custom
  filters for circuit breaking and retries, AWS Network Load Balancer for external gRPC traffic
  (NLB required for HTTP/2 end-to-end), Aurora PostgreSQL with read replicas for low-latency
  reads, ElastiCache Redis for sub-millisecond caching, and X-Ray with custom OpenTelemetry
  instrumentation for distributed tracing at the gRPC method level.
