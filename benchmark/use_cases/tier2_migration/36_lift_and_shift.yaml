prompt: >
  Design a lift-and-shift migration plan for a manufacturing company moving 40 on-premises
  servers to AWS with a 6-week deadline and zero application changes allowed. The on-prem
  environment: 20x Windows Server 2019 app servers (4-16 vCPU, 8-64GB RAM), 8x Linux app
  servers, 5x SQL Server databases (2 of which are Always On AG pairs), 4x file servers
  with 20TB SMB shares, and 3x legacy Oracle databases that are being retired post-migration.
  Use AWS Application Migration Service (MGN) for server replication, FSx for Windows File
  Server for SMB file shares, RDS SQL Server with Multi-AZ for the SQL Server workloads,
  and Site-to-Site VPN for connectivity during the migration window. Calculate the AWS cost
  post-migration and compare to the on-premises TCO of $180,000/year.
