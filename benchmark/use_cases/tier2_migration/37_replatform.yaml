  Design a replatform migration for a logistics company moving 8 Java Spring Boot applications
  from EC2 instances to containerized ECS Fargate, without rewriting application code. Current
  state: 8 EC2 m5.large instances, each running a single monolithic Spring Boot app with a
  shared RDS PostgreSQL db.m5.xlarge and a shared ElastiCache cluster. Target state: containerize
  each app (Dockerfile generated from EC2 AMI analysis), deploy to ECS Fargate with individual
  task definitions and auto-scaling, separate the shared database into per-service schemas with
  connection pooling via RDS Proxy, maintain the shared ElastiCache for session data, move to
  ECR for container registry, and add a CI/CD pipeline via CodePipeline+CodeBuild. Calculate
  the cost delta (expect 30-40% savings from right-sized Fargate tasks vs m5.large EC2).
