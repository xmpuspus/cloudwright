  Design a migration strategy for moving a mid-size SaaS application from AWS to GCP. The
  current AWS architecture: ECS Fargate (6 services), RDS PostgreSQL db.r5.large Multi-AZ,
  ElastiCache Redis, S3 for file storage, CloudFront CDN, and SQS for async tasks. The company
  is switching to GCP due to a Google Workspace enterprise agreement with committed spend.
  Map each AWS service to its GCP equivalent: ECS Fargate -> Cloud Run, RDS PostgreSQL ->
  Cloud SQL PostgreSQL, ElastiCache -> Memorystore, S3 -> Cloud Storage, CloudFront -> Cloud CDN,
  SQS -> Cloud Pub/Sub. Design the migration using Migrate for Compute Engine for stateful
  workloads and Storage Transfer Service for data. Include a dual-write transition period for
  zero downtime. Calculate GCP costs and compare to current AWS bill of $6,500/month.
