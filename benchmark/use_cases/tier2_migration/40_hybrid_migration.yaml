prompt: >
  Design a 12-month phased hybrid migration for a financial institution moving from a
  co-located data center to AWS while maintaining regulatory compliance throughout. Phase 1
  (months 1-3): establish the AWS landing zone with AWS Control Tower, Direct Connect 10Gbps
  primary + VPN backup, and migrate non-critical batch workloads via MGN. Phase 2 (months 4-8):
  parallel run of core banking application in both DC and AWS with real-time data sync via
  DMS, Aurora PostgreSQL as the cloud replica, WAF and Shield Advanced for the cloud-facing
  endpoints. Phase 3 (months 9-12): cut over primary traffic to AWS, decommission DC systems,
  implement PrivateLink for third-party connections replacing dedicated circuits. Provide
  the architecture for the end state and the intermediate Phase 2 parallel-run topology.
