tier: 3
category: "comparison"
prompt: >
  Compare running the same Kubernetes workload on AWS EKS, Google GKE, and Azure AKS for a
  team deploying 20 microservices. Workload spec: 10 nodes (4 vCPU, 16GB RAM each), 500GB
  persistent volumes, 5TB/month egress, a managed ingress controller, and managed logging and
  monitoring. Evaluate and score each platform on: control plane cost (EKS $0.10/hr vs GKE
  Autopilot vs AKS free control plane), node pricing for equivalent VMs, managed add-ons
  included vs paid (logging, monitoring, service mesh), upgrade experience and version support
  windows, and networking model differences (AWS VPC CNI vs GKE dataplane v2 vs Azure CNI).
  Produce a side-by-side monthly cost breakdown and a qualitative scorecard for a team that
  prioritizes operational simplicity over raw cost.
