prompt: >
  Compare AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Azure Functions for a serverless API workload
  processing 50 million invocations per month with an average duration of 200ms and 256MB
  memory. Calculate the exact monthly cost on each platform using 2025 pricing (after free
  tier). Evaluate beyond raw cost: cold start latency by runtime (Node.js, Python, Java on
  each platform), maximum execution duration limits, VPC integration complexity and latency
  impact, concurrency limits and throttling behavior, observability (built-in vs third-party
  required), and deployment package size limits. Also compare the event source integrations
  — specifically, which platform has the best native integration for Kafka, HTTP, and scheduled
  jobs. Recommend the best platform for the described workload with justification.
