prompt: >
  Compare managed PostgreSQL offerings across the three major clouds for a production OLTP
  workload: AWS RDS PostgreSQL, GCP Cloud SQL, and Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server.
  Workload: 4 vCPU, 16GB RAM, 1TB storage, Multi-AZ/HA replica, automated daily backups
  retained 14 days, 5,000 IOPS, 1TB/month read replica traffic. Calculate the exact monthly
  cost on each platform. Evaluate beyond cost: maximum PostgreSQL version support and upgrade
  path, read replica latency and maximum replica count, point-in-time recovery granularity,
  connection pooling built-in vs external (PgBouncer), extensions available (PostGIS, pg_vector,
  TimescaleDB), and maintenance window flexibility. Which cloud has the best managed PostgreSQL
  for a team that needs pg_vector for AI applications?
