prompt: >
  Compare CDN solutions for a high-traffic media website delivering 500TB/month globally with
  content distributed to North America (60%), Europe (30%), and Asia-Pacific (10%). Evaluate
  AWS CloudFront, Cloudflare Enterprise, and Fastly for: egress bandwidth cost (the dominant
  cost at this scale), cache hit ratio and configurability, edge compute capabilities (Lambda@Edge
  vs Cloudflare Workers vs Fastly Compute@Edge), real-time log streaming and analytics, DDoS
  mitigation built-in vs addon, and WAF capabilities. Calculate the monthly bandwidth cost for
  each provider at the stated volumes. Note that CloudFront has AWS data transfer pricing quirks
  — the first 10TB from us-east-1 is different from ap-southeast-1. Recommend the most
  cost-effective option for a media company already on AWS infrastructure.
