  Perform a comprehensive 3-year TCO comparison for migrating a 200-person SaaS company's
  full infrastructure from AWS to either GCP or Azure, versus staying on AWS with optimization.
  Current AWS spend: $45,000/month across EKS (30%), RDS Aurora (25%), ElastiCache (10%),
  S3+CloudFront (15%), misc services (20%). Include in the TCO: 1) cloud infrastructure costs
  (with 3-year committed use discounts vs AWS Savings Plans), 2) egress costs for cross-cloud
  migration (estimated 500TB one-time transfer), 3) engineering migration cost (estimate 6-month
  team of 8 engineers at $150/hr), 4) training and tooling changes, and 5) risk cost of
  migration downtime. Model the breakeven point for switching vs staying. Also show the AWS
  optimization scenario: switch to Graviton3, use Savings Plans, and optimize egress — what's
  the new AWS spend with full optimization?
