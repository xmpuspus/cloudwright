prompt: >
  Design an architecture that satisfies all of the following requirements simultaneously:
  the system must be strongly consistent (all reads reflect the latest write), available
  (100% uptime, no downtime ever), and partition-tolerant (continues operating during network
  splits). Additionally, the system must be globally distributed across 5 regions with sub-5ms
  local read latency, have a budget under $500/month, and use only managed services without
  any EC2 instances. Handle this by explicitly identifying which of the contradictory requirements
  must be relaxed (CAP theorem — you cannot have all three), recommend the appropriate
  consistency model for the stated use case (a global configuration service), and design the
  best achievable architecture given the real-world constraints.
