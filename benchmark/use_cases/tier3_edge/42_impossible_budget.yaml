  Design a production-ready web application on AWS that costs no more than $10/month total,
  including all compute, storage, database, CDN, and monitoring costs. Requirements: a public
  website with server-side rendering, a relational database for user data, user authentication,
  file upload capability, and email notifications. This must be a real AWS architecture using
  real services with real pricing — not a "use the free tier forever" answer (assume past
  12 months and Free Tier expired). Explicitly state which requirements cannot be met at this
  budget, what the real minimum viable cost is for the stated requirements, and design the
  closest achievable architecture (likely Lambda + DynamoDB + S3 + SES) with exact cost
  calculations at 1,000 monthly active users.
