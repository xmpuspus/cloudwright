prompt: >
  Design an AWS architecture for a government healthcare payment processor that must simultaneously
  satisfy HIPAA (PHI), PCI-DSS Level 1 (payment card data), and FedRAMP Moderate (federal
  government data). This is genuinely one of the hardest compliance combinations. Architecture
  must use only GovCloud (us-gov-east-1) services that are FedRAMP authorized, FIPS 140-2
  validated encryption everywhere (KMS with FIPS endpoints, TLS 1.2+ only), three completely
  isolated VPCs for each compliance domain with no direct peering, HSM-backed encryption for
  both PHI and cardholder data, PIV/CAC authentication for federal users via AWS SSO with
  HSPD-12 assertion, and continuous compliance monitoring via AWS Config with NIST 800-53
  conformance pack. Document which AWS services are available in GovCloud and which requirements
  conflict across frameworks.
