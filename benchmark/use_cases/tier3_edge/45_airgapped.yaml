  Design an air-gapped cloud architecture for a defense contractor using AWS Outposts in a
  classified facility with zero internet connectivity. The Outposts rack must operate fully
  disconnected from AWS commercial regions after initial provisioning. Services available on
  Outposts: EC2 (limited instance families), ECS, RDS, ElastiCache, S3 on Outposts, and
  EKS (limited). Design a full application stack that works within these Outposts constraints:
  a containerized application on ECS, RDS PostgreSQL for persistent data, S3 on Outposts for
  file storage, and a local container registry (since ECR requires internet). Handle software
  updates via sneakernet (USB transfer) — design the update workflow. Identify which AWS services
  are NOT available on Outposts and propose alternatives. Assume the facility has 2 redundant
  power feeds and a local network, but absolutely no external connectivity.
